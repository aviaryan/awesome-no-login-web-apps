Hey, thanks for considering contributing to this list. We really appreciate it. 

Please follow the following guidelines when submitting a PR -

* Read the introduction in README and make sure your addition(s) are valid for this awesome list. 
* Description about links should give an account of the outstanding features and major short-coming of the item, if any.
* Description should end with a full-stop.
* Add new items at the bottom of the list of a category.
* New categories can be created if and when needed.
* Add a `[Account]` type listing only when there is no comparable alternative available that works without login.

Apart from that, 

* Try to avoid adding similar apps in **Miscellaneous** section. At max 2 similar kinds of apps are acceptable. 
* If there are lots of similar apps for something you want to add and the thing you are adding has no advantage over them, don't add it. Eg > Youtube downloaders
* Check your spelling and grammar twice before submitting a PR.
